This repository contains the code for a real-time to-do list application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The project uses Socket.IO for real-time updates, allowing users to see changes to the to-do list instantly. With this setup, users can add, update, and remove tasks in real time. This project is a example of integrating a full-stack architecture using modern web technologies.

# Setup
Run `npm i && npm run dev` for both client and server side to start the development server
